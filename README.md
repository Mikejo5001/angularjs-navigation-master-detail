# angularjs-navigation-master-detail
The AngularJS Master-Detail Sample shows you how to create a cross-platform, multi-page app using Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova (CTP3) in Visual Studio 2015 RC. The extension enables the creation of cross-platform apps using Apache Cordova that can run on Android, iOS, and Windows.

The sample creates a master-detail list using AngularJS in a Multi-Device Hybrid App. This sample demonstrates the following:
- AngularJS routing for multi-page apps using the routing module (ngRoute) and partial pages. 
- MVC design using the AngularJS controller (ngController) and AngularJS templates. 
- Data binding (ngModel). 
- Flexible UI design techniques (CSS3 FlexBox, Use of @media queries, CSS overrides for limited
  vw/vh support on some platforms)
- Simple search function using the AngularJS filter. 
- JSON data files that provide the data model. 
- Page animations using CSS3 @keyframes rules. 


### Requirements
Visual Studio 2015 RC with optional cross-platform components for HTML/JavaScript installed.

Note: In VS 2015 RC, project structure is updated for compatibility with 3rd party tools and CLIs. If you need to migrate an older version of an app based on this template to VS 2015 RC, see Known Issues (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=398782).

### Running The App
After you finish downloading and installing VS Tools for Apache Cordova (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=524433), open up the project in Visual Studio.

### Updates
- Project structure updated for VS 2015 RC

### Known Issues
- The Android 4.3 browser has some known limitations, and so the sample may not work perfectly on such devices
